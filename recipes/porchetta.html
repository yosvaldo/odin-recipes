        <h2>Porchetta</h2>
        <p>This is Porchetta. It is Italian culinary tradition. Moist boneless pork meat combined with crispy skin.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 kg Boneless Pork Belly, skin on</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon Fennel Seeds</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Large pinch Sea Salt Flakes</li>
            <li>6 Garlic Cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Small handful of Rosemary, chopped</li>
            <li>Small handful of Sage, chopped</li>
            <li>Small handful of Thyme, chopeed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 Lemon, zested</li>
            <li>Pinch of Chili Flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>250ml White Wine (optional)</li>
            <li>Bread Rolls and Chutney, to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the pork all over with 1 tablespoon Salt. You can do this up to 24 hours before you roll it, but if you don&rsquo;t have time, don&rsquo;t worry. Keep the salted pork covered and chilled.</li>
            <li>Toast the Fennel Seeds and 2 teaspoon Black Pepper in a dry frying pan for a couple of minutes. Pound or blitz the toasted Fennel Seeds and Pepper, a large pinch of Sea Salt Flakes, the Garlic and herbs using a pestle and mortar or mini chopper to make a rough paste. Mix in 2 tablespoon of the Olive Oil, the Lemon Zest and Chili Flakes, if using.</li>
            <li>Lay the pork skin-side down on a chopping board, score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern all over, then cut away a 3-4cm strip of flesh along the long side closest to you, leaving just the skin exposed. This will make it a neater roll later. Massage the herby seasoning mixture deep into the cuts and all over the flesh and place the strip of meat you&rsquo;ve cut away along the middle.</li>
            <li>Starting from the longest side that hasn&rsquo;t been cut, roll the belly up as tightly as you can, with the flap of skin you created in step 3 neatly overlapping at the end. Use butcher&rsquo;s string to tie the joint tightly at 2cm intervals. You can do this up to 24 hours ahead (the flavour will intensify over time).</li>
            <li>When you&rsquo;re ready to cook, heat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. If you have one, put a wire rack or trivet over a large roasting tray and sit the pork on top, or sit the pork in a shallow roasting tin. Massage or brush the remaining 1 tablespoon Olive Oil over the pork skin and sprinkle over some Salt. Roast for 3 hours, basting with the fat every 30 minutes after the first hour of cooking.</li>
            <li>After 3 hours, turn up the heat to 240C/220C fan/gas 9 and roast for a further 20-30 minutes, checking every 10 minutes or so to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t burn. Cook until the skin has crackled well. When the pork is ready, lift it onto a board and rest for 10 minutes. For a lighter gravy, pour the fat out of the roasting tray, leaving behind any caramelised bits. If the tray is flameproof, pour in the Wine, or if it&rsquo;s not, scrape into a saucepan first, then add the Wine. Simmer for a few minutes, then season. Carve the porchetta into slices and serve in soft rolls with chutney, or as a roast with all the trimmings.</li>
